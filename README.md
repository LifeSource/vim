# VI Improved (VIM) Setup 

This repository contains my VIM setup across various machines. It is not intended to be used by others as it has my own customised settings specific for me. 

Installation:

    git clone https://github.com/LifeSource/vim.git ~/.vim

Create Symlinks:

    ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc
    ln -s ~/.vim/gvimrc ~/.gvimrc
